# PHP Script - Index.php
The php script is included in this folder hierarchy. Deploy php script either using MAMP / XAMP/ WAMP. I have used MAMP.
The php folder must contain both json file i.e users.json and quest_paths.json.
To access the script the link will be on Apache server `http://localhost:8080/[folder_name]/index.api?file=users.json`


Error message will appear if `file param is missing` or `incorrect json file` or `json file is missing`.
